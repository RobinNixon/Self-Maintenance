# Implications of the Self-Maintenance Framework

## For Artificial Life

### The Standard View (Challenged)
Traditional artificial life research assumes self-maintenance requires:
- Careful rule design
- Special initial conditions
- Fine-tuned parameters

### The New View
Self-maintenance is the **default outcome** when:
1. Hidden state is present
2. Dynamics are non-pathological (not purely chaotic)
3. Activity is moderate

**Practical Implication:** Designing self-maintaining artificial systems is easier than assumed. Add hidden state to almost any non-trivial dynamics.

## For Origins of Life

### The Standard View (Challenged)
Origins-of-life research focuses on explaining how self-maintenance emerged from non-living matter—treating this as a major transition requiring special explanation.

### The New View
If 83.7% of non-trivial rules become life-like under hidden state, the question shifts:

**Old question:** How did self-maintenance emerge?
**New question:** How did hidden state emerge?

Hidden state in physical systems arises from:
- Activation energy barriers (chemistry)
- Refractory periods (biology)
- Hysteresis (physics)
- Capacitance (electronics)

These are common physical phenomena. Self-maintenance may follow generically.

## For Complex Systems Theory

### Life-Like ≠ Computation
Rule 110 is Turing-complete (can compute anything) but NOT life-like.

**Implication:** Computational universality and self-maintenance are orthogonal properties. A system can be:
- Computationally universal but not self-maintaining (Rule 110)
- Self-maintaining but computationally limited (Rule 184)
- Both (possibly exists, not identified)
- Neither (trivial rules)

### Life-Like ≠ Chaos
Rule 30 is maximally chaotic but NOT life-like.

**Implication:** "Edge of chaos" narratives don't capture life-like behavior. Chaos spreads perturbations; self-maintenance absorbs them. These are opposing tendencies.

### Life-Like ≠ Stability
Rules 108, 201, 216 have perfect stability but are NOT life-like (crystallized).

**Implication:** Too much stability is death, not life. Life requires dynamics—activity in the Goldilocks zone.

## For Physics

### Physical Substrates for Life-Like Behavior

| Physical Mechanism | Hidden State | Example System |
|-------------------|--------------|----------------|
| Activation barriers | Energy levels | Chemical reactions |
| Refractory periods | Recovery state | Neural systems |
| Hysteresis | Magnetization history | Magnetic materials |
| Capacitance | Charge state | Electronic circuits |
| Latching | Locked state | Mechanical systems |

**Prediction:** Physical systems with these properties should naturally exhibit life-like behavior when combined with appropriate dynamics.

## Summary

The framework inverts several standard assumptions:

| Assumption | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Self-maintenance is rare | **INVERTED** — it's the default (83.7%) |
| Special conditions required | **INVERTED** — generic conditions suffice |
| Computation enables life | **REFUTED** — orthogonal properties |
| Chaos enables life | **REFUTED** — opposing tendencies |
| Origins need special explanation | **SHIFTED** — explain hidden state emergence |
